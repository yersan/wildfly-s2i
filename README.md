Wildfly - CentOS Docker images for Openshift
============================================

This repository contains the source for building 2 different WildFly docker images:

* S2I WildFly builder image. Build a WildFly application as a reproducible Docker image using
[source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image).
The resulting image can be run using [Docker](http://docker.io).

* WildFly runtime image. An image that contains the minimal dependencies needed to run WildFly with deployed application.
This image is not runnable, it is to be used to chain a docker build with an image created by the WildFly S2I builder image.

NB: The image created by chaining an s2i build and a docker build is a good candidate to be managed by the [WildFly Operator](https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-operator)

CentOS versions currently provided are:
* CentOS7


Building the images
-------------------

Images are built using [docker community edition](https://docs.docker.com/) and [cekit version 3](https://cekit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
Mac OSX installation and build [tips](doc/build-mac.md).

Cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-s2i
$ cd wildfly-s2i
```

Building WildFly s2i builder image from scratch:

```
$ cd wildfly-builder-image
$ cekit build docker
```

Building WildFly runtime image from scratch:

```
$ cd wildfly-runtime-image
$ cekit build docker
```

S2I Usage
---------
To build a simple [jee application](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-jee-sample)
using standalone [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) and then run the
resulting image with [Docker](http://docker.io) execute:

```
$ s2i build git://github.com/openshift/openshift-jee-sample wildfly/wildfly-centos7:latest wildflytest
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 wildflytest
```

**Accessing the application:**
```
$ curl 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Chaining s2i build with runtime image
-------------------------------------
The following Dockerfile uses multi-stage build to chain builds to create a lightweight image.

```
FROM wildfly/wildfly-runtime-centos7:latest
COPY --from=wildflytest:latest /s2i-output/wildfly $JBOSS_HOME
USER root
RUN chown -R jboss:root $JBOSS_HOME && chmod -R ug+rwX $JBOSS_HOME
RUN ln -s $JBOSS_HOME /wildfly
USER jboss
CMD $JBOSS_HOME/bin/openshift-launch.sh
```

To build the docker image:
* Copy the Dockerfile content into a `Dockerfile` file
* Adjust the `--from` argument to reference the image you first built with s2i
* In the directory that contains the `Dockerfile` run: `docker build --squash -t wildflytest-rt .`

Test
---------------------
This repository also provides a [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) test framework,
which launches tests to check functionality of a simple WildFly application built on top of the wildfly image.
The tests also create a chained build to build a WildFly application runtime image from an s2i build. 

```
$ make test
```
When running tests, the WildFly docker images are first built.

Hot Deploy
------------------------

Hot deploy is enabled by default for all WildFly versions.
To deploy a new version of your web application without restarting, you will need to either rsync or scp your war/ear/rar/jar file to the /wildfly/standalone/deployments directory within your pod.

Image name structure
------------------------
##### Structure: openshift/3

1. Platform name (lowercase) - `wildfly`
2. Base builder image - `centos7`
3. WildFly version or `latest`

Example: `wildfly/wildfly-centos7:17.0`

Environment variables to be used at s2i build time
--------------------------------------------------

To set environment variables, you can place them as a key value pair into a `.s2i/environment`
file inside your source code repository.

* `GALLEON_PROVISION_SERVER`

    The image contains a set of pre-defined galleon definitions that you can use to provision a custom WildFly server during s2i build.
    The set of built-in descriptions you can use as value of the env var are:
     * cloud-profile
     * cloud-profile-h2
     * cloud-profile-mysql 
     * cloud-profile-postgresql 
     * full-profile (Vanilla WildFly configuration for standalone and domain)
     * jaxrs
     * os-standalone-profile (The default server present in the builder image)
     * standalone-profile (Vanilla WildFly configuration for standalone)

* Maven env variables

    * The maven env variables you can set are documented in this [document](https://github.com/jboss-openshift/cct_module/tree/master/jboss/container/maven/api)
    
    * `MAVEN_OPTS`

    Contains JVM parameters to maven.  Will be appended to JVM arguments that are calculated by the image
    itself (e.g. heap size), so values provided here will take precedence.

Environment variables to be used when running application
---------------------------------------------------------

Java env variables

* The Java env variables you can set are documented in this [document](https://github.com/jboss-openshift/cct_module/tree/master/jboss/container/java/jvm/api)
* `ENABLE_JPDA`, set to true to enable debug on port 8787, disabled by default.
* `JAVA_OPTS_EXT`, to append to options to `JAVA_OPTS`

WildFly server env variables

* `AUTO_DEPLOY_EXPLODED`

    When set to `true`, Wildfly will automatically deploy exploded war content.  When unset or set to `false`,
    a `.dodeploy` file must be touched to trigger deployment of exploded war content.

* `CLI_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN` set to true to disable shutdown.

* `DEFAULT_DATASOURCE` defaut to `POSTGRESQL_DATASOURCE` or `MYSQL_DATASOURCE` or `EXAMPLE_DATASOURCE` or `ExampleDS`

* `EXAMPLE_DATASOURCE` default to `ExampleDS`

* `MYSQL_DATABASE`

    If set, WildFly will attempt to define a MySQL datasource based on the assumption you have an OpenShift service named "mysql" defined.
    It will attempt to reference the following environment variables which are automatically defined if the "mysql" service exists:
    `MYSQL_SERVICE_PORT`
    `MYSQL_SERVICE_HOST`
    `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
    `MYSQL_USER`

* `OPENSHIFT_SMTP_HOST` default to `localhost`

* `POSTGRESQL_DATABASE`

    If set, WildFly will attempt to define a PostgreSQL datasource based on the assumption you have an OpenShift service named "postgresql" defined.
    It will attempt to reference the following environment variables which are automatically defined if the "postgresql" service exists:
    `POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_PORT`
    `POSTGRESQL_SERVICE_HOST`
    `POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD`
    `POSTGRESQL_USER`

* `SCRIPT_DEBUG` set to true to enable launch script debug.

* `SERVER_CONFIGURATION` name of standalone XML configuration file. Default to `standalone.xml`

* `WILDFLY_ENABLE_STATISTICS` default to `true`

* `WILDFLY_MANAGEMENT_BIND_ADDRESS`  default to `0.0.0.0`

* `WILDFLY_PUBLIC_BIND_ADDRESS` default to the value returned by `hostname -i`

* Adding datasources can be done by using env variables defined in this [document](doc/datasources.md)

Jolokia env variables

* The Jolokia env variables you can set are documented in this [document](https://github.com/jboss-openshift/cct_module/tree/master/jboss/container/jolokia/api)


Provisioning a custom server using [Galleon](https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The s2i builder image comes with a set of pre-defined galleon maven projects that you can reference from your s2i build 
(thanks to the `GALLEON_PROVISION_SERVER` env variable in the default template or Galleon parameter 
in the chained build template). Names of directories located in this [directory](wildfly-modules/jboss/container/wildfly/galleon/artifacts/opt/jboss/container/wildfly/galleon/definitions/) 
can be value of the template parameter or env variable.

Note: You can use these maven projects as a starting point to define your own WildFly server.

If you want to define your own WildFly server, create a directory named `wildfly-galleon` at the root of your application sources project. This directory must
contains a maven project. During s2i build `mvn install` is called and expects the directory `target/wildfly` to be created in `wildfly-galleon` directory containing a galleon provisioned WildFly server.
This server is used to replace the one present in the s2i builder image. 
In your maven project you must use the [Galleon maven plugin](https://docs.wildfly.org/galleon/#_maven_plugin).

The Galleon feature-pack to use is `org.wildfly.galleon.s2i:wildfly-s2i-galleon-pack:<Wildfly version of the image>`, it is only available from the WildFly s2i builder image 
(located in .m2/repository).

This feature-pack contains the default standalone.xml configuration required for OpenShift. In addition it exposes the following Galleon layers that you can combine with
[WildFly defined galleon layers](https://docs.wildfly.org/16/Admin_Guide.html#defined-galleon-layers):
* mysql-datasource
* mysql-driver
* postgresql-datasource
* postgresql-driver

Note: These Galleon layers are defined in [wildfly-extras Galleon feature-pack](https://github.com/wildfly-extras/wildfly-datasources-galleon-pack).

As an example, this [custom configuration Galleon definition](wildfly-modules/jboss/container/wildfly/galleon/artifacts/opt/jboss/container/wildfly/galleon/definitions/cloud-profile-postgresql/config.xml) 
defined in this [maven project](wildfly-modules/jboss/container/wildfly/galleon/artifacts/opt/jboss/container/wildfly/galleon/definitions/cloud-profile-postgresql) 
combines the WildFly `cloud-profile` with the `postgresql-datasource`


S2i build time WildFly server customization hooks
-------------------------------------------------

 * Wildfly configuration files from the `<application source>/<cfg|configuration>` are copied into the wildfly configuration directory.

 * Pre-built war files from the `<application source>/deployments` are moved into the wildfly deployment directory.

 * Wildfly modules from the `<application source>/modules` are copied into the wildfly modules directory.

 * Execute WildFly CLI scripts by using `S2I_IMAGE_SOURCE_MOUNTS` and `install.sh` scripts as documented in [s2i core documentation](https://github.com/jboss-openshift/cct_module/tree/master/jboss/container/s2i/core/api)
   
This [test application](test/test-app-postgres-custom) highlight the usage of these customization hooks.

Jolokia known issues
--------------------

* On some minishift versions (at least on v1/33.0) you need to disable security to allow Java console to connect to WildFly server Jolokia agent set `AB_JOLOKIA_AUTH_OPENSHIFT` and `AB_JOLOKIA_PASSWORD_RANDOM` to `false`

S2I build known issues
----------------------

**If UTF-8 characters are not displayed (or displayed as ```?```)**

This can be solved by providing to the JVM the file encoding. Set variable ```MAVEN_OPTS=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8``` into the build variables
